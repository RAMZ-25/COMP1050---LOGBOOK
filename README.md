-	The tasks I was assigned was to add the square element into the diagram and label it, also was assigned to label all the arrows in the diagram. 
-	Yes, I did, I needed the shapes to be completed before I could start labelling the arrows and adding the other things in
-	Yes, my team leader was just checking up on us to make sure the tasks were completed.
-	I think it was assigned correctly and nothing was needed to be changed.
-	Yes, because our group didn’t understand what we had to do so if it was a bit clear it would’ve helped us.
-	I think we don’t need to do anything differently, as everything was done correctly and it ran efficiently and all the tasks were completed 
-	Yes, when doing project task allocations in other units it is important to look at the task dependencies when allocating them and scheduling them because you need to see what is important and complete them first and the work onto the less important things, so everything gets completed in time. Balancing the workload is important so we aren’t dependent to others and it is balanced so everyone is doing even amounts of work
