COMP1050 - LOGBOOK 
PRAC 1 – 25/02/2021 
For this lesson we got into groups of 4 to discuss an idea that we could develop potentially develop and produce to the market. We had to do facts, product description, product idea, issues, usage, cost, and how we are going to finish the product in the time frame. Overall, this lesson was a simple lesson getting to know my group and gathering ideas on what we could make a successful product as a group and listing down and upraising ideas that we could implement into the product
-	Product Description - A project product report is a subset of a product description that describes what the project must produce to be approved.
-	Product Idea - The interpretation of the characteristics of the product to highlight the best aspects and maximum features of the product is referred to as design definition. Until selling a product to a consumer, advertisers will investigate the product idea.
-	Group Development 
-	Facts 
-	Issues 
-	Usage 
-	Time Frame 
-	Constraints – What is going to be the limitations and restrictions of this project.
PRAC 2 – 04/03/2021 
This Lesson we started to develop on our ideas and start describing all the functions. So, our group sat down together and start discussing and adding to our report the following design elements for us to have a key outline of our product and see what requirement are need for us to create a successful and innovative product that the market will be benefitting from.
Design:
•	Flow Charts
•	Market Research 
•	Gantt Chart 
•	Functional Requirements 
•	Non-Functional Requirements 
•	Constraints 
•	Hardware Requirement 
•	Software Requirement 
•	System Architecture 
•	Process Model

-	The tasks I was assigned was to add the square element into the diagram and label it, also was assigned to label all the arrows in the diagram. 
-	Yes, I did, I needed the shapes to be completed before I could start labelling the arrows and adding the other things in
-	Yes, my team leader was just checking up on us to make sure the tasks were completed.
-	I think it was assigned correctly and nothing was needed to be changed.
-	Yes, because our group did not understand what we had to do so if it were a bit clear it would have helped us.
-	I think we do not need to do anything differently, as everything was done correctly, and it ran efficiently, and all the tasks were completed. 
-	Yes, when doing project task allocations in other units it is important to look at the task dependencies when allocating them and scheduling them because you need to see what is important and complete them first and the work onto the less important things, so everything gets completed in time. Balancing the workload is important so we are not dependent to others and it is balanced so everyone is doing even amounts of work.

In this weeks, practical class we start to learn how to create a GitHub account which was easy but then we learnt how to use git push, git pull, git add., git commit, and these showed us how to transfer files from your computer to the GitHub just by using codes from the computer. We started to create repositories that our group had shared and have personal ones that enabled us to store our logbooks, etc.
We installed anaconda and used jupyter notebooks to some challenge questions and start learning how to use this program and start to look at the different activity that were there from 1 – 13 from the lecture notes.

This week was just a continuation of last week and just continued using the different data sets and uploading them onto GitHub and did the week HAR-week5 jupyter script and started to answer all the questions and we managed to do this as a group so it was easier for us to understand each question and it was less time consuming and we could finish early and start working on the other things.
The challenge questions were pretty challenging and we managed to complete a few but not everything, but we started to get the hang of it and our group was being really productive and there was no issues that we encountered.

This week was just a continuation of last week and just continued using the different data sets and uploading them onto GitHub and did the week HAR-week 6 jupyter script and started to answer all the questions and we managed to do this as a group so it was easier for us to understand each question and it was less time consuming and we could finish early and start working on the other things.
The challenge questions were challenging, and we managed to complete a few but not everything, but we started to get the hang of it and our group was being productive and there were no issues that we encountered. And this week we managed to complete and upload everything on time, and we had some spare time in our hands, so it was good to use to make sure we completed everything.
